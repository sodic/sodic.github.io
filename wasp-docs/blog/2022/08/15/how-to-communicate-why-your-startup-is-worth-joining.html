You go to their websites and all you see is vague, baseless, overly generic mission-schmission/values-schvalues HR nonsense that supposedly should turn you into a raving fan of whatever they’re doing and make you hit that “Join” button until their servers crash. Well…</p><p>Some people think that’s because most startups aren’t worth joining. I disagree. This argument generalizes one’s own reasons for joining a startup onto every other human being out there, which is unlikely to be true. I think most startups, no matter how ordinary, <em>do</em> have a reason to join them; <em>a good reason</em>; even <em>many good reasons</em> — they just fail to communicate them well. They’re like a shy nerd on Tinder with an empty bio and no profile pic: a kind, intelligent, and thoughtful human being who, unfortunately, will be ruthlessly swiped left — not because he’s a bad match but because his profile doesn’t show why he’s a good one.</p><p>Visually, this “Tinder profile problem” looks like this:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Illustration of candidates not seeing why to join a startup" src="/img/worth-joining/illustration-1-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Now, look what would happen if a startup communicated a bit better. Suddenly, our candidates could see a reason to join. If the reason is good, they might even swipe right.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Illustration of candidates seeing one reason to join a startup" src="/img/worth-joining/illustration-2-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>But most startups have <em>many</em> good reasons to join them. If only they communicated well, the outcome would be something like this:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Illustration of candidates seeing many reasons to join; one candidate already running for it" src="/img/worth-joining/illustration-3-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Now, you’re probably wondering just what exactly those reasons are.</p><p>Here’s a rough list:</p><ol><li>The founders are interesting / fun / smart / human / you name it</li><li>The team is great</li><li>The culture is amazing</li><li>The business is doing well</li></ol><p>However, if you just copy this list and paste it on your jobs page, you will accomplish nothing. The candidates will never believe you. What you need to do instead is to <em>supply them with a system of concretes (facts) from which their minds will form these abstract conclusions.</em></p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Instead of declaring that “the founders are reflective, thoughtful, and persistent,” show them how so, like Sarah from Canny does by writing comprehensive year-in-review blog posts for <a href="https://canny.io/blog/year-four-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four years in a row</a>.</li><li>Instead of proclaiming that “the founders are humble and can have fun,” show them how so, like Michael from Fibery did by becoming a hero of <a href="https://fibery.io/remote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this hilarious page</a>. (No businessy founder would ever agree to make this public. Michael did.)</li><li>Instead of purporting that “the team is great” or “you’ll work alongside very smart people” (God, I hate that one!), show them who exactly those people are, as PostHog does <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and Wasp does <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/12/21/shayne-intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/05/31/filip-intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li></ul><p>In the rest of the post, I’ll go through the four broad reasons to join a startup one by one and show real-life examples of communicating them well. In the end, I will explain how these four reasons, communicated well, fuse into two compelling messages that will interest any candidate.</p><p>One last thing. For the sake of clarity and comprehension, I will write in the second person. Instead of saying “candidates would never believe them,” I will say “you would never believe them.” It’s much easier to read and understand.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="possible-reasons-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining-and-how-to-communicate-them-well"><strong>Possible reasons why your startup is worth joining, and how to communicate them well</strong><a href="#possible-reasons-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining-and-how-to-communicate-them-well" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to possible-reasons-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining-and-how-to-communicate-them-well" title="Direct link to possible-reasons-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining-and-how-to-communicate-them-well">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-founders--or-the-founders-are-interesting--fun--smart--human--you-name-it"><strong>1.

By quickly skimming the posts, you can understand that Sarah and Andrew (the founders):</p><ul><li>Accept their mistakes, talk about them, and learn from them. Even if the issue is sensitive, like firing people. (<a href="https://canny.io/blog/reflections-two-year-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reflections from the last 2 years as a founder</a>, <a href="https://canny.io/blog/hire-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First hire to first fire</a>.)</li><li>Are reflective, thoughtful, and persistent people.

But, more importantly, stand up to them, even if that means losing revenue. (<a href="https://canny.io/blog/saying-no-big-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saying no to big customers</a>.)</li></ul><p>If they just pinned this list of virtues to their Jobs page, you would never believe them. Instead, Sarah and Andrew show what actions they take, how they work, how they think, <em>how they live</em> — and you make up their own mind about what kind of people Sarah and Andrew are from seeing all that. The difference is enormous.</p><p>Note their writing style. They don’t claim to be know-it-alls with titles like “How <em>to</em> bootstrap your startup.” Instead, they write “How <em>we</em> Bootstrapped <em>our</em> SaaS Startup to Ramen Profitability.” They cover only what they know instead of overgeneralizing. This shows both expertise and humility.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Canny&#x27;s Founder Stories blog category" src="/img/worth-joining/canny-founder-stories-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="personal-instagram"><strong>Personal Instagram</strong><a href="#personal-instagram" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to personal-instagram" title="Direct link to personal-instagram">​</a></h5><p>The second thing Sarah and Andrew do well to communicate who they are is their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carryoncode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>. They don’t post glamorous keynote appearances, as many entrepreneurs do. They share the actual day-to-day working life — both the fun and the struggle. It gives you a good idea of what they’re after in life. (Not keynotes.) That’s why it works, and that’s why people love it.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A photo from Sarah and Andrew&#x27;s personal Instagram" src="/img/worth-joining/canny-instagram-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p><em>Side note: Sarah explains how she develops the Canny brand in <a href="https://canny.io/blog/building-your-brand-with-storytelling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>.

In these monthly posts, Michael honestly shares everything that’s going on with Fibery, including the good, the bad, and the ugly: firing people for poor performance, losing important customers, and failing to reach product-market fit. The fact that he’s already written 45 of those (as of Aug 2022) is also telling. And he’s not a native English speaker. If he can do that, why can’t you?</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Fibery&#x27;s Startup Diary blog category" src="/img/worth-joining/fibery-startup-diary-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="crazy-challenges"><strong>Crazy challenges</strong><a href="#crazy-challenges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to crazy-challenges" title="Direct link to crazy-challenges">​</a></h5><p>Besides writing the Startup Diary, Michael also embarks on crazy challenges like <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/100-posts-about-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing 100 posts about products</a>. Only a passionate, driven person would commit to such a thing. You cannot help but respect him for it. (Before this challenge, he wrote 100 Medium posts in 100 days in 2018. You can read them <a href="https://mdubakov.medium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Just scroll a few screens to reach the old stuff.)</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Fibery&#x27;s 100 posts about products blog category" src="/img/worth-joining/fibery-challenges-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>If you look carefully, you’ll notice that Michael’s thinking about building a company is different from Sarah’s. For example, he despises the gentle, soothing “Oh don’t worry that it didn’t work out; you did such a good work!” approach, which is ubiquitous in the modern startup world. Instead, he states that <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/dissatisfaction-leads-to-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dissatisfaction leads to progress</a>, referring to the famous <a href="https://youtu.be/xDAsABdkWSc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Not quite my tempo”</a> scene from Whiplash. Does that make you like him more than Sarah?</p><p>It depends. If you believe that being soft and balanced is better, you’ll go with Sarah; if you believe that real progress comes only from working yourself to the bone, you’ll go with Michael (or Elon). The important thing is that both founders have their own, unique viewpoints of how things should be done, and that they communicate these viewpoints as-is instead of chopping their legs off to fit the latest Procrustean fad.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-depth-original-blog-posts-about-the-industry"><strong>In-depth, original blog posts about the industry</strong><a href="#in-depth-original-blog-posts-about-the-industry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to in-depth-original-blog-posts-about-the-industry" title="Direct link to in-depth-original-blog-posts-about-the-industry">​</a></h5><p>Some entrepreneurs say that doing a startup is like “jumping off a cliff and building your wings on the way down.” Some of it might be true. But if you want <em>reasonable</em> people to jump with you, you better tell them that you have a degree in engineering and know how to assemble wings in a free fall. Otherwise, the only team you’ll recruit is a suicide squad looking for a splashy hit.</p><p>To communicate his expertise, Michael writes in-depth, original, theoretical posts about the nature of knowledge management and organizational productivity. These posts are gems, both literally and metaphorically. (They’re filed under the <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/gems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gems category</a> in the <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fibery blog</a>.)</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/fibery-vision-v1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fibery.io Vision v.1: Getting Started</a></li><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/the-next-wave-of-work-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Next Wave of Work Management Software</a></li><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/augmenting-organizational-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Augmenting Organizational Intelligence</a></li><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/use-networks-to-prioritize-product-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use Networks to Prioritize Product Features</a></li></ul><p>After reading these articles, you understand not only that Michael really knows how to build wings while falling off the cliff, but that he has already jumped a few times. (Prior to Fibery, Michael had worked on knowledge management for more than a decade. He also had built a successful project management software, <a href="https://www.apptio.com/products/targetprocess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Targetprocess</a>.) You know that he’s an expert who can be trusted.</p><p>Interestingly, even though Michael writes differently from Sarah, they both leverage what they’re good at. Sarah does not try to produce treatises on software development philosophy, and Michael doesn’t gush out with his personal learnings from building a startup. That, I think, is the right way to do it.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-posthog-communicates-who-their-founders-are"><strong>How PostHog communicates who their founders are</strong><a href="#how-posthog-communicates-who-their-founders-are" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-posthog-communicates-who-their-founders-are" title="Direct link to how-posthog-communicates-who-their-founders-are">​</a></h4><p>PostHog’s founders James and Tim don’t write 100 posts in 100 days or run a personal Instagram. But they’ve come up with something else to communicate what kind of people they are. And it’s something unique.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="well-written-concise-bio"><strong>Well-written, concise bio</strong><a href="#well-written-concise-bio" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to well-written-concise-bio" title="Direct link to well-written-concise-bio">​</a></h5><p>First, both founders have decent <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">profiles</a> in the company handbook. These bios are short, clear, and humane. They’re also very specific. Where else have you seen the name of the CEO’s cat?</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of James Hawkins&#x27; bio in the PostHog Handbook" src="/img/worth-joining/posthog-james-bio-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="personal-readme-files"><strong>Personal README files</strong><a href="#personal-readme-files" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to personal-readme-files" title="Direct link to personal-readme-files">​</a></h5><p>Second, both James and Tim have an extensive README file (<a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/james-hawkins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one</a>, <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/tim-glaser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a>) on how to work with them. These files give you an insight into their productivity habits, interests, and quirks. In fact, after reading them, you will likely have a better idea of the founders than you’d usually get from working at a company for a month!</p><p>For instance, James’s file has sections like:</p><ul><li><strong>Short bio.</strong> Includes very specific details like: “I tend to work 9am to 5pm with an hour for lunch, then I have a gap to have dinner with my family, then 9pm to around 11pm ish.”</li><li><strong><em>Very clear</em> areas of responsibility.</strong> No need to wonder what the hell the CEO is doing anymore!</li><li><strong>Quirks.</strong> These are remarkably humble and open-minded, like:<ul><li>“If I haven’t responded to something that you’ve sent me, that’s probably because I’ve read it and don’t feel particularly strongly - so just make a call on what to do if you don’t hear back in a reasonable time frame.”</li><li>“I’m a little disorganized. I compensate for this by making sure the teams I work on have this skill. Often I think this actually helps me prioritize the things that really matter.”</li><li>Explaining these quirks is an ingenious move. Besides explaining how to work with James, this section communicates that he’s profoundly self-aware and willing to accept and leverage his weaknesses. These qualities are very rare and incredibly valuable.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What I value.</strong> In stark contrast to most HR nonsense, these values are very clear, very specific, and written in English rather than HRese. (I just came up with this term: it means “legalese but for HR.”) Here are two examples:<ul><li>“Proactivity. Do not ask me for permission to do things - I wouldn’t have hired you if I didn’t trust you. I’d rather 9 things get done well and 1 thing I disagree with than we don’t get anything done at all.”</li><li>“Directness impresses me. If you don’t like something please just say so. It makes for much healthier relationships.”</li></ul></li></ul><p>In addition to that, there’s also: How I can help you, How you can help me, My goals until end December 2022 (very specific!), Personal strategy, Execution todo (including “1 bike ride a week”!) and Archived todo.</p><p>In summary, this README page is a gem. I wish more founders had them.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of James Hawkins&#x27; README in the PostHog Handbook" src="/img/worth-joining/posthog-james-readme-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-we-at-wasp-communicate-who-our-founders-are"><strong>How we at Wasp communicate who our founders are</strong><a href="#how-we-at-wasp-communicate-who-our-founders-are" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-we-at-wasp-communicate-who-our-founders-are" title="Direct link to how-we-at-wasp-communicate-who-our-founders-are">​</a></h4><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="who-we-are-section-of-every-job-description-page"><strong>“Who we are” section of every job description page</strong><a href="#who-we-are-section-of-every-job-description-page" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to who-we-are-section-of-every-job-description-page" title="Direct link to who-we-are-section-of-every-job-description-page">​</a></h5><p>Matija and Martin (the founders of Wasp) embedded a concise description of who they are right into each <a href="https://www.notion.so/402274568afa4d7eb7f428f8fa2c0816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job description page</a> in Notion.

And if they like working on interesting things <em>while having fun</em>, they won’t help but feel an inkling to reach out.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A funny image from Wasp&#x27;s blog post about GitHub Copilot" src="/img/worth-joining/wasp-vibe-blog-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A photo of Wasp&#x27;s team packing t-shirts for users" src="/img/worth-joining/wasp-vibe-tshirts-min.jpeg"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-progress--or-the-business-is-doing-well"><strong>4.

You just state these facts. However, most companies need to attract great people way before Series B. In fact, it is these very people who’re going to get you there. As most startups are secretive about how things are going, communicating that things are going <em>somehow</em> — no matter how negligible your progress in contrast to the big guys — becomes quite an advantage. It immediately de-risks the opportunity in the candidate’s eyes. So, if EXPERTISE is about convincing candidates that you know how to build the wings, PROGRESS is about showing them the half-built carcass on your way down. Both are important if you want great people to jump off the cliff with you.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-canny-communicates-their-progress"><strong>How Canny communicates their progress</strong><a href="#how-canny-communicates-their-progress" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-canny-communicates-their-progress" title="Direct link to how-canny-communicates-their-progress">​</a></h4><p>To give candidates a sense that things are moving, that this company is not some long slog but a place where progress is made every day, that they can become a part of something that’s growing and, therefore, can grow themselves, to do all that, Canny does two things.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="year-in-review-blog-posts"><strong>“Year in review” blog posts</strong><a href="#year-in-review-blog-posts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to year-in-review-blog-posts" title="Direct link to year-in-review-blog-posts">​</a></h5><p>The first one is their “Year in review” blog post series. Such comprehensive, thoughtful reviews are rare in the startup world. What is even rarer is when these posts span over four consecutive years. It sends a message that the founders are persistent and devoted to making this company successful.</p><p>Below are all Canny’s year-in-review posts in a sequential order:</p><ul><li><a href="https://canny.io/blog/lessons-learned-bootstrapping-saas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Year in review: Lessons learned from bootstrapping our SaaS startup</a></li><li><a href="https://canny.io/blog/year-two-lessons-bootstrapping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Year in review: Lessons from our second year of bootstrapping Canny</a></li><li><a href="https://canny.io/blog/year-three-lessons-bootstrapped-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Year three in review: Lessons from growing our bootstrapped startup</a></li><li><a href="https://canny.io/blog/year-four-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Year four in review: Overcoming the unexpected</a></li></ul><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Canny&#x27;s Year in review blog post" src="/img/worth-joining/canny-year-in-review-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="important-revenue-milestones-blog-posts"><strong>Important revenue milestones blog posts</strong><a href="#important-revenue-milestones-blog-posts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to important-revenue-milestones-blog-posts" title="Direct link to important-revenue-milestones-blog-posts">​</a></h5><p>In addition to year-in-review posts, Sarah writes about hitting notable revenue milestones. Like with yearly reviews, such transparency is rare. It attracts attention, causes liking, and builds trust.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><a href="https://canny.io/blog/saas-startup-ramen-profitability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$0 to $3,500: How we Bootstrapped our SaaS Startup to Ramen Profitability</a></li><li><a href="https://canny.io/blog/how-we-built-a-1m-arr-saas-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3,5k to $1m: How we built a $1m ARR SaaS startup</a></li><li><a href="https://canny.io/blog/moving-upmarket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1m to $2m: How we’re moving our SaaS upmarket to enterprise sales</a></li></ul><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Canny&#x27;s How we built a $1m ARR SaaS startup blog post" src="/img/worth-joining/canny-million-arr-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="short-tweets-with-progress-summary"><strong>Short tweets with progress summary</strong><a href="#short-tweets-with-progress-summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to short-tweets-with-progress-summary" title="Direct link to short-tweets-with-progress-summary">​</a></h5><p>Finally, Sarah occasionally tweets short summaries of their progress, like <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahhum/status/1461378442256072712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a>. These tweets work like ads. Over time, a candidate’s brain fuses them into a broader idea like “Canny is growing” or “Canny is doing well.” Then, once a candidate decides to change jobs, it nudges the candidate to consider Canny.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Sarah’s tweet with progress update" src="/img/worth-joining/canny-sarah-tweet-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-fibery-communicates-their-progress"><strong>How Fibery communicates their progress</strong><a href="#how-fibery-communicates-their-progress" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-fibery-communicates-their-progress" title="Direct link to how-fibery-communicates-their-progress">​</a></h4><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="startup-diary-blog-posts"><strong>Startup Diary blog posts</strong><a href="#startup-diary-blog-posts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to startup-diary-blog-posts" title="Direct link to startup-diary-blog-posts">​</a></h5><p>The most notable thing Fibery does to communicate their progress is the <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/startup-diary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Startup Diary</a> blog posts series written by the founder, Michael, every month, <em>for the past 45 months.</em> It’s the longest series of monthly updates I know.

Wasp really end up transmitting is two powerful messages:</p><ul><li>The company is likely to succeed</li><li>Working there will be awesome</li></ul><p>These two messages are the real answer to “why people should join your company.” The trick, however, and the reason why I wrote this post, is that you can only transmit them indirectly. You can’t say “our founders are great.” You need to provide candidates with many-many facts about the founders, which their minds will then fuse into this abstract conclusion. Ditto for expertise, team, culture, and progress. Eventually, these first-level abstractions will blend into still broader ones: “the company is likely to succeed” and “working there will be awesome.”</p><p>Thus, there’s no single, ultimate answer to “why people should join your company.” There’s only a complex system of concrete, specific units of information from which candidates make the answer themselves. In other words, you can’t teach them why your company is likely to succeed and why working here will be awesome. But you can outline the facts and let them learn for themselves. I hope this post shows how to do that outlining well, and I hope you will apply this knowledge to bring talented people onboard and build great things.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg blogPostFooterDetailsFull_mRVl"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/startups">startups</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/hiring">hiring</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/wasp">wasp</a></li></ul></div><div class="col margin-top--sm"><a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/release/web/blog/2022-08-15-how-to-communicate-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></footer></article><div class="mt-8 grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 xl:grid-cols-2"><div class="flex flex-col items-start space-y-3 rounded-lg border border-yellow-500/25 bg-yellow-500/5 p-8"><span class="h-20 rounded-full border border-yellow-500/25 bg-white px-4 py-5 text-neutral-800"><svg height="100%" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 5 30.67 23.25"><title>Discord</title><path d="M26.0015 6.9529C24.0021 6.03845 21.8787 5.37198 19.6623 5C19.3833 5.48048 19.0733 6.13144 18.8563 6.64292C16.4989 6.30193 14.1585 6.30193 11.8336 6.64292C11.6166 6.13144 11.2911 5.48048 11.0276 5C8.79575 5.37198 6.67235 6.03845 4.6869 6.9529C0.672601 12.8736 -0.41235 18.6548 0.130124 24.3585C2.79599 26.2959 5.36889 27.4739 7.89682 28.2489C8.51679 27.4119 9.07477 26.5129 9.55525 25.5675C8.64079 25.2265 7.77283 24.808 6.93587 24.312C7.15286 24.1571 7.36986 23.9866 7.57135 23.8161C12.6241 26.1255 18.0969 26.1255 23.0876 23.8161C23.3046 23.9866 23.5061 24.1571 23.7231 24.312C22.8861 24.808 22.0182 25.2265 21.1037 25.5675C21.5842 26.5129 22.1422 27.4119 22.7621 28.2489C25.2885 27.4739 27.8769 26.2959 30.5288 24.3585C31.1952 17.7559 29.4733 12.0212 26.0015 6.9529ZM10.2527 20.8402C8.73376 20.8402 7.49382 19.4608 7.49382 17.7714C7.49382 16.082 8.70276 14.7025 10.2527 14.7025C11.7871 14.7025 13.0425 16.082 13.0115 17.7714C13.0115 19.4608 11.7871 20.8402 10.2527 20.8402ZM20.4373 20.8402C18.9183 20.8402 17.6768 19.4608 17.6768 17.7714C17.6768 16.082 18.8873 14.7025 20.4373 14.7025C21.9717 14.7025 23.2271 16.082 23.1961 17.7714C23.1961 19.4608 21.9872 20.8402 20.4373 20.8402Z"></path></svg></span><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Join our developer community</h3><p>Wasp is 100% open source.
